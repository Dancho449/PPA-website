        <h4>SAY THESE WORDS:</h4>

        <p>Today I confess Jesus, as my Lord and Saviour. I believe He came to the earth, I believe He died,   and I believe, that on the 3rd day, He was raised from the dead. Everything Jesus did, by His death, burial and resurrection, I receive into my human spirit. I receive the gift of eternal life. I am Born Again. Thank You Jesus. Hallelujah!</p>
